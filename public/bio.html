      <p class='bio'>The brains, heart & soul behind this operation. Known for his innate ability to sleep at any time, he can also befriend even the most dangerous and vicious of household cats. If he isn't eating Milk Steak (put that, she'll know what that is), drinking tallboy Old Style's, or traveling the globe for <em>"work"</em>, you can find him tuning into the Cubs on FM radio or majestically riding through St. Paul, Minne-snow-da (don't let him tell ya he's in Minneapolis).</p>
